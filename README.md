# Cute Baby Animals Cicky Game

## Overview:

This is a memory game that utilizes React. The app's UI is broken up into components, with one stateful component passing the managed state to the non-stateful components, all in response to user events.

## How the game works:
* The application renders 15 different images of cute, baby animals to the screen
* Each time the user clicks on an image, the pictures are randomly shuffled
* The goal for the user is to click on each image once
* The application keeps track of the user's score, the number of images that are click on once
* When the user clicks on any image a second time, the current game is concluded, and the number of Correct Guesses is reset to 0
* The application tracks the user's highest score, and updates when the user achieves a new High Score
